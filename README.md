# FontinaTP Nexus: FontinaTP Nexus Server, a Python program to ease NAT hole punching.
FontinaTP Nexus Server is a program written in Python that allows two FontinaTP clients to exchange informations about eachother to initiate a *TCP Hole Punching* procedure. FontinaTP Nexus Server comprehends some security functions, to make sure that only authorized clients can connect to it; it also handles the informations exchange via unique session codes, to be sure that clients cannot connect to other clients randomly.

# Planned Functions and Roadmap
What follows is a *sort of* comprehensive list of all feature that will be implementend in FontinaTP. This list is subject to change at any time, since new idea will inevitably come up during development.
- Handling of incoming connections :hammer_and_wrench:
- SQL Server Connector for Sessions and Authentication :hammer_and_wrench:
- Information Exchange between clients :x:
